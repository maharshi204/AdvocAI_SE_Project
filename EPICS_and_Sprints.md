## **EPICS**

Epics are a key concept in Agile (Scrum).

An **Epic** is a **large body of work** that can’t be completed in a single sprint. It represents a **big feature or theme** of the product. Epics are broken down into **User Stories** (smaller, manageable pieces). Epics are mostly delivered as a set of sprints. Over the course of the development phase, with the help of customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed to the epics as necessary. 

Following are the EPICS related to our project with sample user stories.

### **1\. Document Simplification**

* Epic: As a user, I want the system to simplify legal documents so I can understand them easily.

* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want to upload a PDF/DOCX of a legal document.  
  * As a user, I want the system to provide a detailed summary of the legal documents in the form of bullets, in easy to understand language.  
  * As a user, I want high risk clauses in the document to be highlighted with the help of AI.  
  * As a user, I want simple definitions to be provided for complex legal terms.  
  * As a user, I want to ask the system for further clarifications or clause-wise explanations.

### **2\. Document Generation, Editing & Version Control**

* Epic: As a user, I want to create and edit legal documents with AI assistance.

* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want to generate a draft of a legal document on the basis of the case description provided.  
  * As a user, I want that the standard draft is customized on the basis of the details provided, using AI.  
  * As a user, I want to be able to add, delete, modify clauses in the generated document with the help of AI as well as manually.  
  * As a user, I want AI to suggest grammar/legal corrections.  
  * As a user, I want to save and revise drafts.  
  * As a user, I want that each edition of the document should be stored as different versions.  
  * As a user, I want that anytime I should be able to roll-back to previous versions.

### **3\. Collaboration**

* Epic: As multiple parties, we want to edit documents together and track changes.

* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want that multiple parties can collaboratively work on the same document.  
  * As a user, I can suggest changes and make comments in the document, that other parties can view, accept, reject or can make further suggestions.  
  * As a user, I want to see who made what change, when.  
  * As a user, I want to comment on specific clauses.

### **4\. E-signature & Security**

* Epic: As a user, I want to securely sign documents online.

* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want to digitally sign the documents with authentication such that it fulfills the legal provisions  
  * As a user, I want all signatures logged with timestamps.  
  * As a user, I want the e-sign to be added as a watermark to my document.  
  * As a system admin, I want encryption to secure sensitive data.

### **5\. Lawyer Connection**

* Epic: As a user, I want to connect with lawyers for case-specific help.

* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want to browse lawyers by specialization.  
  * As a user, I should be able to filter lawyers on the basis of expertise, experience, rating, fees, etc.  
  * As a user, the system should suggest to me lawyers on the basis of the case description provided, using AI.  
  * As a user, I want to chat with a lawyer securely.  
  * As a lawyer, I want to review client documents.  
    

## **SPRINT**

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.  It generally lasts from one to four weeks

The following are the sprints for our project:

**Sprint 1**

Our sprint 1 covers the development of the basic interface and functionality for the epics Document Summary, Document Generation and Lawyer connect.

* User can log in/sign up on the website  
* User can upload the legal document in PDF format and a basic summary will be provided for the document  
* Users can ask the AI document generator for drafting a legal document by providing basic information about the type of case and a basic template for the case will be provided.  
* Users can view lawyers along with their field of expertise, experience, contact details, etc. They can contact the lawyer using the details provided on their own.


**Sprint 2**

Our sprint 2 will be considering further expansions to the above mentioned features

* The complex legal legal terms are explained to the user using definitions in simple, easy to understand language.  
* The user can further ask for clarifications, clause based explanations, by providing inputs to the AI using chat  
* The document generator customizes the standard templates on the basis of user details and case briefing provided with the help of AI  
* The user can add, modify, delete any of the clauses in the generated document either manually or by providing prompts to bot with AI assistance


**Sprint 3**

Sprint 3 consists of making the features more advanced

* The system provides the user with the high risk clauses that may lead to legal complications from the document provided by the user.  
* Each edit versions of the document are stored as different versions of the document and the user can anytime rollback to the previous versions of the document  
* The user can filter the lawyers on their area of expertise, experience, fees, rating, etc.  
* The AI helps users to find the best lawyer based on the case details provided.  
* The user can request for e-signing the generated documents


**Sprint 4**

Final advancement of the features

* Multiple parties can collaboratively make suggestions/comments on the generated documents.  
* All the parties can view, accept, reject or further suggest changes to the comments.  
* The comments accepted by all the parties are updated in the document.  
* Users can request to connect to a lawyer via the platform.   
* A lawyer can view the request from the user, the case details and document and accept/reject the consultation.
