# Definition

## Survey Elicitation Technique  
The **Survey Elicitation Technique** is a method of collecting structured input from stakeholders through carefully designed surveys.  
It is used to gather both:  

- **Functional requirements** (specific features or services users need)  
- **Non-functional requirements** (qualities such as trust, usability, and personalization)  

This technique helps in understanding user needs, expectations, and preferences, allowing for the mapping of these insights to system features.

# Why We Used This Method

### Relevance to Target Users  
Since our platform (**AdvocAI**) is user-centric, we needed direct feedback from potential users.  

### Scalability  
A single Google Form could reach a large and diverse audience quickly.  

### Balanced Data Collection  
The form had closed-ended questions for quantitative analysis and open-ended questions for qualitative insights.  

### Ease of Participation  
Stakeholders could respond anytime and anonymously, encouraging more honest answers.  

### Efficient Requirement Gathering  
This allowed us to collect both functional requirements and non-functional requirements simultaneously.
