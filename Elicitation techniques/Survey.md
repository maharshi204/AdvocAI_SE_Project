**Survey Elicitation Technique:**  
The Survey Elicitation Technique is a method of collecting structured input from stakeholders through carefully designed surveys. 
It is used to gather both **functional requirements** (specific features or services users need) and **non-functional requirements** (qualities such as trust, usability, and personalization) to guide system design and development. 
This technique helps in understanding user needs, expectations, and preferences, allowing for the mapping of these insights to system features.
